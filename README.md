# Modern-Portfolio-Theory  
**1. Introduction**  
In this project, I will implement Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), also known as mean-variance analysis, using a portfolio composed of stocks from the five largest companies by market capitalization: **AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOG, and AMZN**. Basically, MPT is a mathematical approach to portfolio construction that aims to maximize expected returns for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a target level of expected return. You can find more detailed information about MPT in the following link: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory#:~:text=Modern%20portfolio%20theory%20(MPT),%20or%20mean-variance%20analysis,%20is).  

**2. Implementation**  
First, I retrieved the stock data for the 5 companies using the yfinance library in Python, with the start date set to five years ago and the end date being the most recent available. The images below display the stock price trends for each company over the years: ![Stock Prices](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1lq-tYVQ9bo7gTwyiRFlI5bnudLcC2qEk).  
Next, I calculated the log returns of the five stocks and plotted their histograms to examine the distribution: ![Returns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iBqabVagxIttpQpR04AlNEW3fhAKqBrU). Based on the graphs, it quite hard to determine whether the log returns adhere to a normal distribution. If the normality assumption is violated, it could result in deviations from the expected outcomes of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), potentially leading to suboptimal portfolio solutions. To clarify this, I will further examine the QQ plot. ![Stock Prices](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dcmzl5WDMFNVH9HxyOPZ6V6jwrxfCZNT)  
I also performed a normality test in my code, and the results consistently indicate that real-life stock returns rarely meet the normality assumption. However, for the purposes of this project, I will assume that my stocks conform to this assumption.
